## Motive
In my closet, there is a shelf dedicated to diaries I've collected over the years.  
Writing in my diary was one of the first ways I learned to organize my thoughts,  
relieve stress, self-reflect, and foster creativity. I wanted to create this app  
to make diaries more accessible in hopes that more people will enjoy its benefits.
